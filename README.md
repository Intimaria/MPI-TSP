Description
============
For this project I implemented a parallel formulation for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is a NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization. Given a list of cities with their pairwise distance, the task is to find the shortest route that visits all the cities once and returns to the origin city. The problem was formulated in 1930 and is one of the most intensively studied problems in optimization with applications in planning, logistics, and the manufacturing of micro-chips.

Source code
===========
You can download the source code of the application here: https://github.com/mvictoras/MPI-TSP
git clone https://github.com/mvictoras/MPI-TSP

Compilation
===========
I have included a Makefile to compile the project.
